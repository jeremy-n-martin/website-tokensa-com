            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has called for a \"modest\" increase in the gas limit to potentially improve the network's throughput. Notably, the gas limit has remained unchanged for nearly three years, marking the longest period of stability in Ethereum's history.</p><p>Currently set at 30 million, Buterin proposes raising the gas limit to around 40 million, representing a 33% increase. Since the network's inception in 2015, the average gas limit has steadily risen from 3 million, reflecting the growing usage and adoption of Ethereum.</p><p>The gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas that can be utilized for executing transactions or smart contracts within each block. This limit ensures that blocks maintain an optimal size, preventing any adverse impact on network performance and synchronization. Validators have the ability to dynamically adjust the gas limit within specific parameters while producing blocks.</p><p>By increasing the gas limit, more transactions can be included in each block, theoretically enhancing the overall throughput and capacity of the Ethereum network. However, this adjustment also places additional strain on hardware and raises concerns about potential network spam and attacks.</p>",

Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator and later Binance's regional markets head, will assume the role of CEO.</p><p>According to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday, Binance was accused of several violations, including the failure to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violating sanctions laws.</p><p>Under the terms of the plea agreement, Binance will be required to appoint an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years. The company will also need to report its compliance efforts to the U.S. Government. CZ Zhao is prohibited from any present or future involvement in the operation or management of Binance.</p><p>As part of his agreement, CZ Zhao will pay a $175 million release bond and commit to returning to the U.S. 14 days prior to his sentencing scheduled for February 23, 2024. He has also agreed to provide the court with his residence information, and a warrant could be issued for his arrest if he fails to appear for his court date.</p>",

The proposal outlines the potential SPK pre-farming airdrop plan for the lending protocol Spark Protocol and reviews the general SubDAO farming economic model, which is set to launch in the second phase.</p><p>The proposal suggests retroactively calculating which users have borrowed from the Spark Protocol and starting the calculation from the moment when the borrowing interest rate was raised to 5%. Token distribution will be based on the proportion of the volatile assets they have collateralized and the duration of time. Users will be eligible for the airdrop without taking any specific action.</p><p>Over a span of 10 years, a total of 2 billion SubDAO tokens will be distributed to each SubDAO participant. In the first two years, the initial farming rate is 500 million SubDAO tokens annually, with 350 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewStable yield farmers and 150 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewGovToken yield farmers each year.</p><p>For the following two years (third to fourth year), the initial farming rate reduces to 250 million SubDAO tokens annually, with 175 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewStable yield farmers and 75 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewGovToken yield farmers each year.</p><p>MakerDAO's End Game plan involves breaking down the existing DAO structure into smaller autonomous entities called SubDAOs.

            "content": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/uniswap/overview\">Uniswap</a> announced a new protocol called UniswapX on EthCC 2023, which aimed to provide the best quotes for on-chain swaps by aggregating liquidity from various DEXs. The protocol outsources routing and batching to a permissionless set of fillers, and uses Permit2 executable off-chain signatures, allowing gasless trading, MEV protection, cross-chain trading, and more. To learn more about UniswapX, please check out TokenWiki: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/tokenwiki/all/what-is-uniswapx\">What is UniswapX | TokenInsight</a></p><p>UniswapX quickly drew loads of attention from the crypto community, as well as criticism. Someone thought that the aggregator mechanism of UniswapX was nothing new, and its fillers had the same function as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/cow-protocol/overview\">Cow Swap</a>'s solver model.</p><p>When Dan Robinson, Head of Research at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/capitals/paradigm\">Paradigm</a> and contributor of Uniswap, shared the five reasons he thought \"UniswapX changes the game for decentralized exchange, MEV, and interoperability\" on Twitter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/curve-finance/overview\">Curve Finance</a> commented, \"Dan, with all respect. The game was changed long ago by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/1inch/overview\">1inch</a> when they first did high-quality aggregation and Cow Swap when they pioneered the solver model. It's good stuff, but you are not really the first or the second.\"</p><p>Interestingly, the two projects Curve mentioned, 1inch and Cow Swap, both mocked UniswapX by memes. Cow Swap said, \"thank you Uniswap for validating even more our trading design! Welcome to the party.\"</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/news/content/img/cow_meme.jpeg\"></figure><p>And Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch, used the classic Mr. Bean meme.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/news/content/img/1inch_mem.jpeg\"></figure><p>Related: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/uniswap-announced-uniswapx-to-offer-better-prices-by-aggregating-liquidity-sources\">Uniswap Announced UniswapX to Offer Better Prices by Aggregating Liquidity Sources</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/tokenwiki/all/what-is-uniswapx\">What is UniswapX | TokenInsight</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most important and cutting-edge trends in the world of crypto.

The amount lost, $3m, is something that SA can recover in about 10 days or so. Worst case, the team can borrow $3m and pay it back with interest.</p><p>\"Remember that Wormhole got hacked for $300m and is still around. Axie Infinity lost $625m and is still around.

Nonetheless, this event has led to the adoption of preventative security measures.</p><p>Lido Finance confirmed the vulnerability was related to potential root-level access that impacted 25 of InfStones’ validator servers. Lido clarified, however, that there’s no evidence of any key leakage or exploitation as a result of this issue.</p><p>\"To clarify: There is currently no indication of key leakage or compromise, and the vulnerability may not affect validators related the Lido protocol,\" it said.</p><p>In its security report, dWallet Labs alleged the vulnerability could have potentially triggered a security breach impacting the ETH staked through InfStones’ nodes on Lido. Consequently, the firm recommended the rotation of validator keys for all nodes that were possibly exposed to the vulnerability.</p><p>InfStones said the issue flagged by dWallet only affected a small part of its infrastructure, with less than 0.1% of its systems via a specific network port on its network that had the issue. As such it implied the affected validator nodes was a small number.</p>",

Token swaps on the chain peaked at $5 for simple swaps but have since receded to under $0.5.</p><p>The surge in activity can be attributed to a novel category of tokens known as \"PRC-20,\" inspired by the Ordinals token standards on Bitcoin. Users have been prolifically minting PRC-20 tokens, specifically named POLS. Notably, these tokens are created using transactional calldata on the Polygon blockchain, deviating from the conventional ERC-20 token standard.</p><p>This unique mechanism draws inspiration from Ordinals, a protocol designed for generating tokens and NFTs on the Bitcoin network. The process, termed \"inscription,\" assigns data to individual satoshis across the Bitcoin network. In contrast, Polygon-based PRC-20s employ a distinct strategy, utilizing transaction calldata to generate tokens or unique NFT-like image artifacts embedded within the network transactions.</p>",

As the trial is canceled, the SEC may appeal the decision on the programmatic sales and other distributions of $XRP.</p><p>According to TokenInsight data, the price of $XRP went up by 7.22% over the last 24 hours, trading at $0.518122 now.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/news/content/img/xrp_price_oct_20.png\"></figure><p>To learn more about the Ripple case, please visit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/topic/ripple-vs-sec\">Ripple vs SEC</a></p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img2023102012363426621293-2699-405b-9b4d-eaf177ca374e.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/ripple/overview\">Ripple‘s</a> Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has called on validators within the XRP Ledger community to consider adopting an automated market maker (AMM) feature. However, he emphasizes that this adoption should only occur if a consensus is reached within the community. In a recent discussion on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Schwartz highlighted the potential benefits of integrating AMMs into the XRPL.</p><p>In early 2022, Ripple proposed a novel AMM design for the XRP Ledger. It has subsequently been implemented on a devnet, with a mainnet launch being contingent upon governance approval. Unlike traditional AMMs, such as those on Ethereum, it integrates directly into the XRP ledger itself as a core primitive.</p><p>This AMM is a protocol-native AMM, which means that liquidity is shared at a blockchain level, and it is easy for developers to integrate AMM functionality into their projects, removing pain points such as liquidity bootstrapping.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20231009100239dc4801c9-9004-4bc3-b37a-9f7ba25b626f.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

Token distribution will be based on the proportion of the volatile assets they have collateralized and the duration of time. Users will be eligible for the airdrop without taking any specific action.</p><p>Over a span of 10 years, a total of 2 billion SubDAO tokens will be distributed to each SubDAO participant. In the first two years, the initial farming rate is 500 million SubDAO tokens annually, with 350 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewStable yield farmers and 150 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewGovToken yield farmers each year.</p><p>For the following two years (third to fourth year), the initial farming rate reduces to 250 million SubDAO tokens annually, with 175 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewStable yield farmers and 75 million SubDAO tokens allocated for NewGovToken yield farmers each year.</p><p>MakerDAO's End Game plan involves breaking down the existing DAO structure into smaller autonomous entities called SubDAOs.

The growth and development of these networks were dependent on the managerial efforts of the founders and management teams of these tokens and were reasonably believed to lead investors to a profit from their entrepreneurial and managerial efforts. Additionally, sums of the tokens' distribution were reserved for their founders and management teams, thereby appearing to tie the fortunes of the token holder to the management teams, creating a common enterprise. Accordingly, the Tokens were securities.\"</p></blockquote><p>James asked the court to order KuCoin to stop operation in New York, and to block New York-based IP addresses from accessing KuCoin's app, website and services.</p><p>According to CoinDesk, this is the first time a regulator has claimed in court that $ETH is a security. On the definition of $ETH, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/cftc-vs-sec-are-stablecoins-and-ether-commodities-or-securities\">have different opinions</a>. Previously, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he viewed all digital assets except for Bitcoin as securities, while CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam claimed $ETH was a commodity. James' lawsuit file, however, said that $ETH falls within the Martin Act's definition of both commodities and securities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most valuable news in the world of crypto.

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

Hedera also reported that the suspicious activity was detected when the attacker tried to move the stolen tokens across the Hashport bridge, which included liquidity pool tokens on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/saucerswap/overview\">SaucerSwap</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/pangolin/overview\">Pangolin</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/heliswap/overview\">HeliSwap</a>.</p><p>The operators acted promptly and temporarily paused the bridge to prevent the movement of stolen tokens. The team at Hedera did not confirm the amount of tokens that were stolen.</p><p>Hedera managed to shut down network access by turning off IP proxies on March 9 and stated that it has identified the root cause of the exploit and is working on a solution. Once the solution is ready, Hedera Council members will sign transactions to approve the deployment of updated code on the mainnet to remove the vulnerability. The team added that once the mainnet proxies are turned back on, normal activity will resume.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230310043557d511017d-d1e9-44f9-9d9f-cac52fedb582.jpg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most valuable news in the world of crypto.

Nominators receive staking rewards when their chosen validators act honestly, but have their collateral slashed when the validators exhibit malicious behaviors. In November 2022, Polkadot introduced nomination pools to lower the staking entry barrier. Nomination pools allow token holders to stake as low as 1 $DOT and to entrust nomination management to the pool operators. There are currently four ways to stake $DOT natively: running a validator, nominating directly, opening a nomination pool, and joining a nomination pool.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/news/content/img/dot.png\"></figure><p>According to the report, the $DOT total supply increased steadily from 1.25B on November 1, 2022 to 1.32B on May 31, 2023, while the total stake amount dropped from 638.13M (51.13% staking ratio) to 569.13M (43.14% staking ratio). Overall, the $DOT price correlated moderately with the staking ratio.</p><p>From November 2022 to May 2023, the amount of validators remained relatively stable between 917 and 990, while the total nominator count surged in November 2022 and reached a peak of 47,672 on December 5, 2022. Most of the nominator rewards stayed in the range of 87.78K to 178.50K $DOT.</p><p>At the beginning of May, the Polkadot nomination pools surpassed 10K in total members and 4M $DOT in total stake. Daily pool rewards rose rapidly from 3.22 $DOT on November 2, 2022 to a maximum of 2.83K $DOT on May 22, 2023.</p><p>For more information, please read <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dotinsights.subwallet.app/polkadot-staking-report-h1-2023-en/\">Polkadot Staking Report H1 2023</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most important and cutting-edge trends in the world of crypto.

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

In the future, Synthetix stakers will only receive rewards from trading fees, with the protocol set to introduce a buy-back and burn mechanism once its Andromeda upgrade is deployed on Base.</p><p>The rationale behind the proposal, published by Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, was that the effectiveness of inflation has diminished over time compared to the initial introduction which worked to incentivise liquidity and bootstrap the protocol. Additionally, the recently proposed buyback and burn experiments would be counter-intuitive if inflation continued.</p><p>The Synthetix team said that SNX will become deflationary following the rollout of Andromeda. Half of the trading fees generated from Andromeda will be used to purchase and burn SNX tokens, with stakers receiving the other 50% of fees as rewards.</p>",

It aims to provide a better user experience compared to other decentralized exchanges, primarily by eliminating the need to sign a blockchain transaction for each transaction.</p><p>Initially, Infinex will only offer perpetual trading services. Still, Warwick acknowledged that the exchanges that have dominated every crypto cycle have typically offered multiple trading products in one place. He adds, \"Having just perps is not going to be enough, there's no question. But I think, given where the market is now, launching with perps and really getting that right will be sufficient to bring some traders across. And then once you've got that foothold, then you can work out how you expand from there.\"</p><p>On the regulatory front, Synthetix said it won't be implementing user restrictions on the front end like other decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, dYdX, and 1inch.</p><p>Related: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/synthetix-to-launch-new-perpetuals-dex-infinex-eliminating-the-need-to-sign-each-transaction\">Synthetix to Launch New Perpetuals DEX Infinex, Eliminating the need to Sign Each Transaction</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most important and cutting-edge trends in the world of crypto.

For instance, traders are required to bridge assets to the layer-2 rollup and exchange them for sUSD, Synthetix’s stablecoin used as margin collateral, before they can begin trading. Adding to the inconvenience, each order or cancellation on the existing platform necessitates the trader’s wallet signature, incurring a small fee.</p><p>To compete with the likes of Binance, Infinex is making a key change to the typical DeFi user experience — it’s eliminating the need to use a crypto wallet to sign transactions. Instead, Infinex will greet users with the near-ubiquitous flow of creating a username and password.</p><p>Warwick explained that Infinex would generate a unique public-private key pair for each user, stored locally in the browser, solely used for signing trade orders and not for fund withdrawals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most important and cutting-edge trends in the world of crypto.

The integration will provide an \"easily-pluggable component\" for Polygon-based networks to use Celestia for data availability.</p><p>After the integration, transaction fees could be reduced more than 100 times after the network stored compressed transaction data on Celestia instead of Ethereum.</p><p>Layer 2 networks developed on Polygon's CDK employ zero-knowledge rollup technology. They aggregate transactions off-chain and finalize in bundles on the mainnet. However, Ethereum lacks a dedicated execution environment for its DA layers. Ethereum nodes must process and store data on-chain indefinitely, resulting to increased fees for Layer 2 solution. Celestia enables rollups and other modular chains to utilize the network as a data availability and consensus layer.</p>",

Token swaps on the chain peaked at $5 for simple swaps but have since receded to under $0.5.</p><p>The surge in activity can be attributed to a novel category of tokens known as \"PRC-20,\" inspired by the Ordinals token standards on Bitcoin. Users have been prolifically minting PRC-20 tokens, specifically named POLS. Notably, these tokens are created using transactional calldata on the Polygon blockchain, deviating from the conventional ERC-20 token standard.</p><p>This unique mechanism draws inspiration from Ordinals, a protocol designed for generating tokens and NFTs on the Bitcoin network. The process, termed \"inscription,\" assigns data to individual satoshis across the Bitcoin network.

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income.

During the assessment, several critical and exploitable vulnerabilities were identified by Halborn and have since been fixed by the Dogecoin team. However, after a broader review, Halborn determined that the same vulnerabilities affected over 280 other networks.</p><p>The most critical vulnerability discovered is related to the peer-to-peer (p2p) communications, which could allow attackers to craft malicious consensus messages and send them to individual nodes, causing them to shut down and expose the network to risks like 51% attacks and other severe issues.</p><p>Halborn has successfully developed an exploit kit for Rab13s that includes a proof of concept with configurable parameters to demonstrate the attacks on different networks. All the necessary technical information has been shared with the identified stakeholders to help them remediate the bugs and release the necessary patches for the community and miners.</p><p>Halborn is not releasing further technical or exploit detail at this time due to the severity of the issues.

This design comprises two key components:</p><ol><li>MixHash, a new hashing algorithm intended to replace commonly used algorithms such as Keccak256 and SHA256.</li><li>Public data storage proofs, which enable anyone to present proofs to a public network, verifying their possession of a copy of specific public data marked by MixHash.</li></ol><p>The proposal also delves into the practical implementation of this design across various scenarios and suggests enhancements to the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards.</p><p>Datamall Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain decentralized storage protocol. It has an on-chain storage service matching market and can provide fair prices for storage services in real time based on supply and demand.</p><p>With the approval of the ERC-7585 proposal, DMC is poised to contribute to the ongoing evolution and development of the Ethereum ecosystem, fostering innovation and advancements in decentralized storage solutions.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The most significant one is the problem of centralization of block template construction.</p><p>“Even though hashrate may be distributed globally, the reality is that the intelligent parts of mining (running a full node, sourcing transactions, constructing the block template) are performed by very few individuals and the pools that they control,” said OCEAN's Global Head of Sales, Bitcoin Mechanic. “This is a disproportionate level of influence by too few over too many and has the potential to hurt Bitcoin.” After the launch, OCEAN will introduce a way for miners to independently perform block template construction while still reaping the economic benefits of being in a pool.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

Previous proposals, SIP 24 and 25, failed to reach the 70% quorum required to move forward. Meanwhile, multiple exchanges have contacted the Foundation regarding $STG's liquidity issues, warning that the token will be delisted or deprioritized in the future if a market maker is not engaged.</p><p>To address this issue, Stargate Foundation considered several market makers and proposed GSR as the market maker for $STG. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/capitals/gsr\">GSR</a>, a leading market maker, ecosystem partner, and active, multi-stage investor, will provide much-needed liquidity to the market. In exchange, GSR is requesting 8,000,000 $STG tokens option for a 24-month term with a strike mechanism at an average price greater than $1.15.</p><p>The proposal is now open for community voting. If approved, the Stargate DAO will proceed with GSR as the market maker for $STG. However, if the proposal is voted down, the DAO will proceed without a market maker for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Potential delisting will also have negative consequences to the on chain volume for the STG token. Currently, the Stargate DAO owns almost all on chain liquidity and earns significant fees from trading activity that uses this liquidity. A portion of the activity is arbitrage between on chain liquidity and centralized exchanges. A lack of a robust centralized exchange pool results in less liquidity and decreases the ability for this arbitrage to happen and results in less fees earned by the DAO.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The project's first stage was released on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023.</p><p>In the future, the team intends to nudge the project into a major decentralized application platform and enable other projects to launch, leveraging the so-called shared security.</p><p>That version will enable the amount of ETH re-stakes on EigenLayer — currently over $1.7 billion — to be supplied to all services developed on the network simultaneously for the sake of a common security mechanism. This would make it economically unviable for an attacker to take down any given protocol.</p>",

Although several media platforms, including CoinDesk, don't think the move is helpful for $USDC to overtake $USDT, Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute, holds a different opinion. He tweeted that removing most stablecoin pairs is a good thing, and Binance's decision \"is positive for $USDC\", as users will still be able to deposit and withdraw $USDC seamlessly on Binance, while not having to convert $USDC to $BUSD manually to trade $BUSD margined perpetual contracts. In addition, Evgeny Gaevoy thinks that Binance's auto- conversion is not good for $USDT. \nJeremy Allaire agrees with Evgeny Gaevoy's opinion by retweeting his post and quoting it as \"spot on\". He wrote on his Twitter that, \"Converged dollar books on Binance — now same as on FTX and Coinbase — is a good thing. $USDC utility just increased,\" before predicting that \"this move leads to a gradual net share shift from $USDT to $BUSD and $USDC.\"\nBefore Binance, rival exchanges like FTX and Coinbase have taken similar approaches. FTX, which doesn't have its own stablecoin, aggregates stablecoin deposits of $USDC, $TUSD, $USDP and $BUSD as USD in its customer's exchange wallets while accounting for $USDT balances separately.",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income. In the event that the mining pool engages in harmful activities, individual miners have the option to discontinue their association with the pool and seek alternatives.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230920095354c957461a-da41-430b-be66-851268c66483.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

Developed by the Bitget global copy trading and derivatives exchange, the Bitget Wallet, formerly known as BitKeep, is a powerhouse among wallets, sporting a streamlined and seamless user experience and connection to a wide range of networks.</p><p>The connection of the Bitget Wallet will be available on WOOFi via mobile and desktop through a browser extension, making it accessible for instant operations with the myriad services the two applications offer. Apart from staking and asset transfer via networks like BNB, Optimism, and Linea, Bitget Wallet also provides a holistic Web3 entry experience and will allow users of WOOFi to stake and make use of the protocol’s many features.</p><p>“Our ongoing mission is to make decentralized trading both accessible and user-focused. Partnering with Bitget Wallet is a significant step in realizing that objective,” as commented by a member of the WOOFi team.</p><p>The connection of Bitget Wallet marks a turning point for WOOFi, which currently stands at line 15 among top trading protocols by trading volume and boasts an impressive 650,000 monthly active users. WOOFi has already integrated the Bitget Swap multi-chain DEX aggregator and is now intent on improving its overall user experience. The team has also stated that the choice fell on Bitget Wallet as a gateway to such convenience thanks to the application’s proven track record and broad available user base.</p><p>The Bitget Wallet was formerly known as BitKeep, but <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitkeep-upgrades-to-bitget-wallet\">got rebranded</a> after the exchange acquired it for a $30 million investment, completely merging it with its host of services and transforming it into a gateway. The resulting application allows users to transact using a large number of cryptocurrencies and acts as an access point to multiple services, which Bitget is constantly expanding and updating. Bitget leveraged the new application as a powerful marketing instrument and an attractive application to have in any project’s arsenal, allowing it to forge partnerships with Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, and many other market players.</p>",

In response, WOO X said on Twitter, \"so a foreign language media misreported a story about WOO X being insolvent. Needless to say, we are not. Transparency has always been our core value and unfortunately that makes us a target for elaborate but false assumptions.\" In addition, the DEX posted the link of its Live Balance Sheet in the comment section.</p><p>In his report, Chris Brunet said that, similar to FTX having Alameda Research, WOO X has a dubious hedge fund called Kronos Research. \"Although I lack concrete evidence, I suspect that Kronos may be employing WOO X's deposits for speculative purposes.\" he said.</p><p>In addition, Chris Brunet said that WOO X's custody ratio shown on its website is lower than 80%. \"Even in the most optimistic scenario of a bank run, WOO X can only cover approximately 80% of deposited funds.\" Meanwhile, according to Nansen's data, over 76% of WOO X's reserve is in its own token $WOO.</p><p>However, according to WOO X website, the current reserve ratio of the platform is 127.7%, while the custody ratio is 80.8%. Regarding the fact that the custody ratio is below 100%, there has been an explanation on WOO X's website. \"The custody ratio shows what percent of user deposit liabilities are stored with custodians or in cold storage, versus stored in third-party liquidity sources. Currently, some shares of users' deposits are utilized for hedging and liquidity aggregation on third-party platforms to provide the best price execution for traders on WOO X.\"</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/news/content/img/369.png\"></figure><p>\"Funds on exchanges are used solely for hedging and liquidity aggregation purposes, and are never used for speculation. The custody ratio reports the amount of user deposit liabilities safeguarded in custody and insulated from counterparty risk with third-party exchanges and market makers. Moreover, WOO Network monitors third-party credit-worthiness 24/7/365 to minimize counterparty risk. Assets exposed on liquidity sources can be recalled to custody if counterparty risk is deemed too high.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies\">TokenInsight</a> is dedicated to covering the most important and cutting-edge trends in the world of crypto.

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

The EVM mainnet is scheduled for release on April 14, with updates and improvements planned in the coming weeks and months.</p><blockquote><p>“Combining the performance of EOS with the familiarity of Ethereum, Solidity developers are in for a treat. At 800+ swaps per second, $EOS EVM will be BY FAR the fastest EVM, benchmarked 3x faster than Solana + BNB and 25x faster than Avax” La Rose <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/BigBeardSamurai/status/1630923966914211842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1630923966914211842%7Ctwgr%5E62cc048aaede6c07e5fc0b798d46f1220f3ec077%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Ftech%2F2023%2F03%2F06%2Feos-blockchain-plans-second-innings-ahead-of-aprils-evm-launch%2F\">Tweeted</a></p></blockquote><p>EVMs are the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. By deploying EVMs on other blockchains, developers can build dApps and DeFi applications similar to those built on Ethereum. This is a large part of EOS’s future plans. The foundation says that “EVM compatibility is essential to the potential of EOS, not just technically but also from a business perspective. Ultimately, it is essential that we welcome more Solidity developers and users to EOS, and an EVM on EOS is an excellent bridge to do just that.”</p><p>The foundation has also launched a grants program to fund developers working on such applications. Grants will range from $10,000 to over $50,000, based on criteria such as the size and scope of the initiative. They can be provided to builders of wholly-new products or to fund maintenance and upgrades of existing tools.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Mining Pool ViaBTC currently wields a substantial 53.8% of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/zcash/overview\">Zcash</a> network's total hash rate, as reported by MiningPoolStats. This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income. In the event that the mining pool engages in harmful activities, individual miners have the option to discontinue their association with the pool and seek alternatives.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230920095354c957461a-da41-430b-be66-851268c66483.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income. In the event that the mining pool engages in harmful activities, individual miners have the option to discontinue their association with the pool and seek alternatives.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230920095354c957461a-da41-430b-be66-851268c66483.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The project's first stage was released on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023.</p><p>In the future, the team intends to nudge the project into a major decentralized application platform and enable other projects to launch, leveraging the so-called shared security.</p><p>That version will enable the amount of ETH re-stakes on EigenLayer — currently over $1.7 billion — to be supplied to all services developed on the network simultaneously for the sake of a common security mechanism.

The proposal to reduce liquidity mining incentives will be submitted to governance on Friday, February 17th.</p><p>The security emissions will be reduced by exactly 30% compared to the previous period, with an inflation rate of 5.6 $CANTO per block. Currently, 50% of the circulating $CANTO supply is staked for network security, this is at the higher end of the target range of 40-50% and the proposed adjustment is aimed at maintaining the staked supply ratio within the targeted range while decreasing the inflation rate.</p><p>The liquidity mining parameters will face a reduction across the board compared to the previous period, with liquidity mining incentives dropping to a total of 37.6 $CANTO per block.

The gtcETH is the first on-chain offering that enables holders to earn rewards from a diverse set of liquid staking tokens while simultaneously supporting the funding of digital public goods.</p><p>The gtcETH is built on Index Coop's EVM-based protocol and is composed of three tokens from the top liquid staking protocols on Ethereum, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/lido-dao-token/overview\">Lido</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/rocket-pool/overview\">Rocket Pool</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/stakewise/overview\">StakeWise</a>. These three liquid staking protocols were chosen based on several factors, including having a minimum of $25 million secondary market liquidity on Ethereum's mainnet and being open-source.</p><p>One of the motivations behind the gtcETH is the unpredictability associated with funding digital public goods, such as open-source code, blockchain, or open data sets.

Token holders of gtcETH incur an annualized streaming fee of 2%, with 1.75% going to the Gitcoin decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and the remaining amount to Index Coop. According to Index Coop's snapshot vote, if gtcETH had a total value locked of $1 million, it would contribute roughly $17,500 a year to Gitcoin Grants, placing the index in the top ten in Gitcoin's Funders Leaderboard.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

The project's first stage was released on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023.</p><p>In the future, the team intends to nudge the project into a major decentralized application platform and enable other projects to launch, leveraging the so-called shared security.</p><p>That version will enable the amount of ETH re-stakes on EigenLayer — currently over $1.7 billion — to be supplied to all services developed on the network simultaneously for the sake of a common security mechanism.

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

However, the report forecasts a decline in network hash rate as inefficient miners struggle to remain profitable due to reduced block rewards and increased mining difficulty after the halving.</p><p>The report said hash rate fell by an average of 9% over the six months following past halvings as inefficient miners were forced to cease operating.</p>",

The most significant one is the problem of centralization of block template construction.</p><p>“Even though hashrate may be distributed globally, the reality is that the intelligent parts of mining (running a full node, sourcing transactions, constructing the block template) are performed by very few individuals and the pools that they control,” said OCEAN's Global Head of Sales, Bitcoin Mechanic. “This is a disproportionate level of influence by too few over too many and has the potential to hurt Bitcoin.” After the launch, OCEAN will introduce a way for miners to independently perform block template construction while still reaping the economic benefits of being in a pool.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Mining Pool ViaBTC currently wields a substantial 53.8% of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/zcash/overview\">Zcash</a> network's total hash rate, as reported by MiningPoolStats. This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income. In the event that the mining pool engages in harmful activities, individual miners have the option to discontinue their association with the pool and seek alternatives.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230920095354c957461a-da41-430b-be66-851268c66483.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

The Blast Early Access is currently live on an invite-only basis, with all participants earning Blast Points rewards. Whitelisted users can earn yields (4% on ETH and 5% on stablecoins) and Blast Points ahead of the mainnet launch in February 2024, with early access members earning more points based on the number of bridges and referrals.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

This situation raises concerns, as it theoretically enables the mining pool to engage in malicious activities such as double spending attacks.</p><p>In response to this potential threat, exchanges like Coinbase have implemented precautionary measures. They now require 110 block confirmations before confirming ZEC deposits, resulting in a deposit time of approximately 2.5 hours. The primary objective behind this move is to mitigate the risk of double spending. Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. This threat emerges when a single entity controls over 51% of the hash rate in a proof-of-work blockchain.</p><p>It's important to note that this dominance doesn't stem from a single miner but rather from a mining pool. Mining pools are collections of numerous miners who combine their computational resources to achieve a more consistent income. In the event that the mining pool engages in harmful activities, individual miners have the option to discontinue their association with the pool and seek alternatives.</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20230920095354c957461a-da41-430b-be66-851268c66483.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The users submit their orders to the agent, which then puts them in escrow or an atomic transaction while it finds matching orders.

The ar.io network plans to remove Irys bundlers from the Arweave main gateway’s trusted set, leading to severe delays before user data becomes available.</p><p>Williams opined that forking makes sense for a permanent storage network by saving and building on the state rather than breaking it, which will only result in the unachievable goal of information permanence where all data is periodically discarded. He added that the only reason for Irys to fork could be greed and hopes that Irys will fork the right way.</p><p>Responding to the Arweave founder’s “Irys plans to fork Arweave” narrative, Irys tweeted that it is tragically ironic that Sam Williams, whose life’s work has been to make Arweave open-source and permissionless software, is trying to rip Irys out of Arweave. Irys has never and will never take away users’ choice of where their data is stored.</p><p>Irys processes about 95% of Arweave transactions and has been referred to as an Arweave scaling solution. It rebranded in October this year and claimed to have processed over a billion transactions.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

However, the report forecasts a decline in network hash rate as inefficient miners struggle to remain profitable due to reduced block rewards and increased mining difficulty after the halving.</p><p>The report said hash rate fell by an average of 9% over the six months following past halvings as inefficient miners were forced to cease operating.</p>",

The most significant one is the problem of centralization of block template construction.</p><p>“Even though hashrate may be distributed globally, the reality is that the intelligent parts of mining (running a full node, sourcing transactions, constructing the block template) are performed by very few individuals and the pools that they control,” said OCEAN's Global Head of Sales, Bitcoin Mechanic. “This is a disproportionate level of influence by too few over too many and has the potential to hurt Bitcoin.” After the launch, OCEAN will introduce a way for miners to independently perform block template construction while still reaping the economic benefits of being in a pool.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Cryptocurrency derivatives trading has become integral to the crypto space, with perpetual contracts overwhelmingly dominating the derivatives landscape, both on and off-chain. On-chain derivative trading protocols have mainly evolved in two directions: one follows the centralized exchange (CEX) order book model, facing challenges about sacrificing decentralization for a seamless trading experience. The other, exemplified by the GMX-based GLP fund pool model, operates as a lending model where Liquidity Providers (LP) lend funds for user positions, resulting in LP losses if users profit. While this model simplifies the user experience, it limits the trader's position size to the LP fund pool and exposes LPs to significant losses in a one-sided market.</p><p>Equation, a decentralized perpetual contract protocol based on Arbitrum, combines the advantages of decentralized, efficient, and transparent features similar to spot Automated Market Makers (AMM). It excels in price discovery for perpetual contract products, significantly enhancing capital efficiency.</p><p>Equation, audited by third-party auditor ABDK, utilizes the innovative Balanced Rate Market Maker (BRMM) model. This model allows traders to establish larger and unrestricted positions with lower liquidation risk (MMR = 0.25%), leveraging up to 200x. Simultaneously, liquidity providers can enhance capital efficiency by using leverage on Equation.</p><p>Launched on the Arbitrum mainnet on October 28, 2023, Equation swiftly climbed to the 13th position among 162 on-chain derivative exchanges, according to DefiLlama data on the day of writing.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20231121041535f1760a20-0688-49ab-99e5-3376ed0d2237.jpg\"></figure><p>Equation's BRMM model, inspired by the spot market AMM mechanism, calculates the balance rate of the liquidity pool based on the temporary position ratio held by liquidity providers. This rate is then used to determine the contract price's premium relative to the index price, facilitating price discovery. As a genuine perpetual contract mechanism, users' position sizes are not restricted by liquidity pool, depending solely on the counterparty's scale. The liquidity provided by LPs acts only as temporary counterparty liquidity, thus facing temporary position risk.</p><p>On the 24th day after the mainnet launch, Equation achieved a leverage liquidity of $596,584,794 within the protocol, with a perpetual contract trading volume of $296 million and an open interest of $76,183,194.</p><p><strong>Fair Launch and Burn Mechanism:</strong></p><p>Equation's native token is EQU, with a maximum supply of 10 million. The entire supply is generated through position mining, liquidity mining, and referral mining, rewarding the community. Currently, 224,877 EQU tokens have been mined, and they are listed on major decentralized exchanges.</p><p>Equation allocates 50% of the tokens to traders through position mining. LPs, benefiting from increased capital utilization through leverage and capturing more trading fees, also find this distribution method favorable.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20231121041536440497fc-339f-42ab-9c6b-5d463bf02f92.jpg\"></figure><p>Equation offers two staking mining modes using EQU: EQU/ETH LP NFT staking mining and EQU single-token mining, both with different lock-up periods. Presently, 159,872 EQU are staked, indicating confidence in the project's development, typically correlating with a positive view and longer token holding periods.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img20231121041536dc4bfd8f-3149-41b2-8856-ce7f1250d182.jpg\"></figure><p>Recently, Equation DAO approved a proposal suggesting proportional burning of a portion of EQU not used for long-term staking, aiming to potentially increase the value of assets held by EQU holders. This strategy further encourages and rewards long-term investments in the ecosystem.</p><p>In the decentralized perpetual contract space, factors like trading costs, position limits, liquidity pool depth, and maintenance margin directly influence the trading experience. Equation enhances the trader's perception of cost-effective trading services through measures such as funding rates, fee discounts, and holding mining. For liquidity providers, the variance in capital utilization efficiency offered by DEXs directly determines where they allocate their capital. Equation, by not directly making LPs the counterparties in trades, enables LPs to use less capital to earn more trading fees and token (EQU) rewards, making it an attractive choice for LPs.</p><p>BRMM successfully addresses the challenges of low capital utilization and poor trading experience exhibited by the AMM model in the application of decentralized perpetual contract products.</p><p>As one of the DeFi protocols advocating for a \"fair launch,\" Equation is actively showcasing how community-driven innovation shapes the future of decentralized finance. Prioritizing security and transparency, it aims to provide traders with a reliable and secure perpetual contract trading environment.</p><p>Website: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.equation.org/\">Equation</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EquationDAO\">EquationDAO</a></p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

This includes ensuring that all circulating stablecoins are fully backed by reserves that are at least equal to their par value.

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

Though the team said the issue had been fixed, it was exploited yesterday, and around $3 million was stolen.

But Stars Arena said, \"A special white hat development team is coming in to rapidly review the security of the platform. We will re-open the contract with all the funds in full after a full security audit. This will happen very soon.\" adding, \"We're not going anywhere.\"</p><p>Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Avalanche, also expressed his support for the project. He clarified that the project was built by the Builder and the Arena team, and it was \"a fantastic product that has proven its virality in the market.\" The losses were \"only $3m\", and he was \"confident that the hole will be plugged\".</p><p>He said, \"Stars Arena is a profitable service that makes money. The amount lost, $3m, is something that SA can recover in about 10 days or so. Worst case, the team can borrow $3m and pay it back with interest.</p><p>\"Remember that Wormhole got hacked for $300m and is still around. Axie Infinity lost $625m and is still around. SA will definitely be around. There are some haters out there, which is a testament to SA's success. The bottom line is that SA is insanely fun and viral, and the hack is a mere speed bump on the path to buttoning down the contract.\"</p><p><img src=\"https://s2.tokeninsight.com/static/calendar/img2023100811112409589d8e-8ce0-41af-ae68-a06b6b695b70.jpg\"></p><p>Stay updated with the most important <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/news\">cryptocurrency news</a> and valuable insights, conveniently delivered to your email every day. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/tokeninsight/newsletter\">Subscribe to the TokenInsight mailing list now!</a></p><p>Prefer social media?

            "content": "<p>Reported by Coindesk, a bug in Ethereum's Nethermind client software – used by validators of the blockchain to interact with the network – knocked out a chunk of the chain's key operators on Sunday.</p><p>It was a manageable incident, but the episode revived a long-simmering debate in the Ethereum ecosystem around the need for \"client diversity.\" Some experts took the opportunity to point out how bad things could have been if another client software, Geth, the chain's most popular execution client, had gone out; the question is whether Ethereum could have kept going since Geth stands out as a possible single point of failure for the network.</p><p>Nethermind powers around 8% of the validators that operate Ethereum, and this weekend's bug was critical enough to pull those validators offline. Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The project's first stage was released on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023.</p><p>In the future, the team intends to nudge the project into a major decentralized application platform and enable other projects to launch, leveraging the so-called shared security.</p><p>That version will enable the amount of ETH re-stakes on EigenLayer — currently over $1.7 billion — to be supplied to all services developed on the network simultaneously for the sake of a common security mechanism.

Only 13.24% of the $ETH supply is being staked, whilst the staking ratio of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/cardano/overview\">$ADA</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/solana/overview\">$SOL</a> are over 70%. One of the reasons that stops people from staking $ETH is the lack of ability to unstake. This will not be a problem after the Shanghai upgrade, which will mitigate the risks of staking.</p><p>For liquid staking solutions, they need to deal with another challenge prior to the enabling of staked $ETH withdrawals, which is to keep their LSD pegged to $ETH. In Blockworks' year-in-review of 2022, researcher <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/2022-year-end-review-protocol-highlights#liquid-staking\">Dan Smith</a> said, \"one of the issues for staking derivatives throughout this year (2022), primarily $stETH, has been the ability to keep price parity with $ETH due to the inability to directly arbitrage via withdrawals. This (the Shanghai upgrade) should therefore help alleviate price concerns while also giving users the ability to obtain their $ETH if they so choose.\" This also explains why liquid staking protocols benefit from the upgrade.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

The project's first stage was released on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023.</p><p>In the future, the team intends to nudge the project into a major decentralized application platform and enable other projects to launch, leveraging the so-called shared security.</p><p>That version will enable the amount of ETH re-stakes on EigenLayer — currently over $1.7 billion — to be supplied to all services developed on the network simultaneously for the sake of a common security mechanism. This would make it economically unviable for an attacker to take down any given protocol.</p>",

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

Additionally, the recently proposed buyback and burn experiments would be counter-intuitive if inflation continued.</p><p>The Synthetix team said that SNX will become deflationary following the rollout of Andromeda.

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",

            "content": "<p>Reported by The Block, blockchain project Uma has rolled out a solution called Oval, which aims to allow DeFi protocols to capture value that emerges during oracle updates by tapping into what’s known as oracle extractable value — a type of MEV generated when protocols request price updates from an oracle.</p><p>MEV involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order in a block on the Ethereum network, often with the aid of automated bots. This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.</p><p>There is one type of MEV related to oracles, as Uma notes. In the decentralized finance niche — and in protocols such as lending or borrowing — oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.</p><p>“MEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,” Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. “Oval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It’s been a privilege to work with Flashbots’ best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.”</p><p>Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.</p>",

Domo expressed concerns about the rushed nature of the updates, stating that they overlook peer indexers and potentially pose risks to the broader BRC-20 user community.</p><p>Domo highlighted recent bugs associated with the Ordinals 0.8 and 0.9 updates, underscoring the increasing complexities of integrating new updates into the BRC-20 standard. Domo emphasized the need for thorough testing, coordination, and validation infrastructure before integrating such changes, stating that the current environment may not be safe for their integration.</p><p>Following the controversy, UniSat clarified that the proposed update would result in a split within the current protocol.

Ethereum stayed up and running despite the issue, and Nethermind's developers released a patch fixing things within hours. The main consequence of the bug was that modest financial penalties fell onto some Nethermind-based validators.</p><p>Around 85% of Ethereum's validators are currently powered by Geth, and the recent outages to smaller execution clients have renewed concerns that Geth's dominant market position could pose grave consequences if there were ever issues with its programming.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the bug, a Geth glitch could halt the entire network, rendering it impossible for validators to add new blocks to the blockchain. Ethereum is also programmed to penalize validators that fall offline or break the network's rules, meaning thousands of Geth-based validators could be held financially liable in the event of a bug, and the penalties could get even bigger if the bug proves difficult to patch.</p>",
